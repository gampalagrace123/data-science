Developed a web text summarization tool that extracts content from webpages using Beautiful Soup and generates concise summaries using Sumy’s Lex Rank algorithm. 
The system converts long articles into 10–15-line summaries, making it easier to quickly grasp key information. 
The project demonstrates skills in web scraping, natural language processing, and Python programming and can be used to summarize online articles efficiently.
